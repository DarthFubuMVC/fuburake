<!--Title: NUnit Tests-->


  <Section title="List Testing Projects in TESTS.txt" id="teststxt">
    This option is the default and requires no explicit configuratino.  As a way to make project and solution generation easier, we moved the list of testing projects to a TESTS.txt file in the root directory.  That file looks like this example from [FubuMVC.ViewEngines](https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/FubuMVC.ViewEngines):

<pre>
  FubuMVC.Core.View.Testing
  FubuMVC.Razor.Tests
  FubuMVC.Spark.Tests
  ViewEngineIntegrationTesting
</pre>

  </Section>

  <Section title="Explicitly Define Testing Projects" id="explicit">
If you don't want to use the TESTS.txt file and prefer the testing projects be explicitly defined in your rake file, just set the <code>:unit_test_projects</code> option like this:

<Snippet name="explicit-tests"/>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Integration Testing" id="integration">
If you want a specific task for integration testing separate from unit tests for the "fast build/slow build" segregation, there's a helper to define an <code>:integration_test</code> task like this:

<Snippet name="integration-test"  />
  </Section>
