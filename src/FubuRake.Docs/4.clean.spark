<!--Title: Cleaning before new Builds-->

A typical task in any build automation strategy is to _clean_ out an existing directory (test results, artifacts, build results) before starting a new build.  FubuRake supports this by building a <code>:clean</code> task for you that deletes all the files and child folders in the directories that you declare like the following sample:

<Snippet name="clean-task"/>

Do note that the _artifacts_ folder is automatically added to the <code>:clean</code> task for you if you enable the <ProjectLink name="Ripple"/> integration.
